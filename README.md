To present myself i'm TeK, I'm 21 and i'm a well known developer on Rust, Garry's Mod, FiveM and many other games.

I'm the founder and developer of https://www.raftmodding.com/ and https://www.greenhellmodding.com/  :)

In my programming life (Over the last 10 years) i did many small games, modded many games, created mod loaders like the two ones above.
More recently i also did many plugins on rust, such as never seen ones ranging from Atlantis Stargate Teleporters to Meteorite Plugins & Deep Code Modification with Harmony IL Patching.
